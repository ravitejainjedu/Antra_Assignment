What will happen if this code executes?

int max = 500;
for (byte i = 0; i < max; i++)
{
WriteLine(i);
}

Create a console application and enter the preceding code. Run the console application
and view the output. What happens?
What code could you add (don’t change any of the preceding code) to warn us about the
problem?

Answer:

The loop never ends. Since byte wraps at 255 back to 0 (in unchecked context), after printing 0–255 it overflows to 0 again, so i < 500 is always true and the numbers replay endlessly.
To catch the overflow, wrap the for in a checked context so an OverflowException is thrown at the wrap point:

int max = 500;

checked
{
    for (byte i = 0; i < max; i++)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(i);
    }
}
This doesn’t alter the original loop but flags the overflow when i goes past 255.
